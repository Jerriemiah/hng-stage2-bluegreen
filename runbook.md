**Project:** Blue/Green Deployment with Observability & Slack Alerts  
**Author:** Jerriemiah  

---

## 1. Overview

This runbook describes how to monitor, interpret, and respond to alerts generated by the `alert_watcher` service, which monitors the Nginx access logs and sends notifications to Slack when failovers or high error rates occur.

---

## 2. Alert Types

### **1. Failover Detected**
**Triggered When:**  
Nginx switches active upstream pool (e.g., Blue → Green or Green → Blue).  
Detected by comparing the last-seen `pool` value in log entries.

**Example Slack Message:**  
> :rotating_light: Failover detected! Pool switched from **blue → green**

**Operator Action:**  
1. Verify that the failed pool container is down or unhealthy:
   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   docker logs hng-stage2-bluegreen-app_blue-1
